The group solidified their place in the South Korean music industry with follow-up singles \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\", \"Oh!\", and \"Run Devil Run\" from late 2009 to early 2010.",

    "name": "Crayon Pop",
    "descriptionShort": "Korea's girl group",
    "descriptionLong": "Crayon Pop (Hangul: 크레용팝) is a South Korean girl group under Chrome Entertainment, consisting of Geummi, Ellin, Choa, Way and Soyul. Crayon Pop officially debuted on 19 July 2012 with their performance of \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet's M! Countdown. Their first EP, Crayon Pop 1st Mini Album, was not a commercial success, and when \"Dancing Queen\" was released in October, the group had few opportunities to promote on music shows. Instead, they promoted themselves through guerrilla performances on the streets of Seoul, which helped increase their fanbase, including their male fans called \"Pop-jeossi\". \n Following the release of \"Bar Bar Bar\" in June 2013, Crayon Pop's unique stage outfits and choreography drew interest and their popularity rose. \"Bar Bar Bar\" became a viral hit and eventually reached number 1 on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100. It also earned Crayon Pop numerous awards, including New Rising Star at the Golden Disk Awards, the Hot Trend Award at the MelOn Music Awards, and Best New Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. \n Crayon Pop has held several solo concerts in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, and has also performed in other countries including Australia, China, and the United States. In June and July 2014, the group was the opening act for Lady Gaga's ArtRave: The Artpop Ball concert tour in twelve cities across North America. Their sixth single, \"Uh-ee\", was released on 1 April 2014, and Strawberry Milk, a sub-unit consisting of twins Choa and Way, debuted with The 1st Mini Album on 15 October.",
